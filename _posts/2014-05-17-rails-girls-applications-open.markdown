Applications are now open for the first ever [Rails Girls Auckland](http://railsgirls.com/auckland).

The workshop is on the 4-5th of July at VendHQ's offices in Newmarket. We're aiming to teach 40 people who identify as girls or women to create a web application using Ruby on Rails.

Earlier this year, the Rails Girls Wellington team held a workshop. The team from The Wireless NZ checked it out, and you can [read and listen to their piece here](http://thewireless.co.nz/longwave/2014/4/19) to find out more about the event.

Rails Girls is suitable for beginners, and for people who already code in another language. It's also suitable for girls aged 10 or over. If you, your daughter, or a women you know has been thinking about learning to code, we'd love for you to apply.

We believe coding is like magic - it's fun, it's creative, and it's inspiring.
